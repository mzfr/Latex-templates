\chapter{INTRODUCTION TO ORGANISATION}

 The Honeynet Project \cite{b4} is a leading international 501c3 non-profit security research organization, dedicated to investigating the latest attacks and developing open source security tools to improve Internet security. With Chapters around the world, our volunteers have contributed to fight against malware (such as Confickr), discovering new attacks and creating security tools used by businesses and government agencies all over the world. The organization continues to be on the cutting edge of security research by working to analyze the latest attacks and educating the public about threats to information systems across the world.

Founded in 1999, The Honeynet Project has contributed to fight against malware and malicious hacking attacks and has the leading security professional among members and alumni. Our mission reads "to learn the tools, tactics and motives involved in computer and network attacks, and share the lessons learned" with three main pillars:


\begin{itemize}
  \item \textbf{Research}: attackers and malicious software they use.
  \item \textbf{Awareness}: of the threats and vulnerabilities that exist on the Internet today.
  \item \textbf{Tools}: The Honeynet Project engages broader security community via Google Summer of Code (GSoC) and other efforts to expand security tool development. 
\end{itemize}
